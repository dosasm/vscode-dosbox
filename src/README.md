# SOURCE CODE

The code can be complicated for codes are designed for run in following environment

- `global`: nodejs vscode extension host, all codes
- `window`: webview script, the `emulators` folder
- `self`: webworker vscode extension host, jsdos related codes including `emulators`,`jsdos`

The code in [emulators/](emulators/) are copied from <https://github.com/js-dos/emulators> for modification to run in VSCode.
